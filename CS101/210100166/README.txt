Required Features

ðŸ‘‰ Modify the bubble movement to incorporate vertical motion such that the bubbles travel in a parabolic path.
ðŸ‘‰ When the ball hits the horizontal ground, it should bounce off the ground.
ðŸ‘‰ Introduce collision between the bubble and the bullet; the bubble disappears after a bullet hits it. After a collision, you can make the bullet disappear too.
ðŸ‘‰ Introduce collision between the bubble and the shooter; the shooter is dead if a bubble touches it.

        All required features are implemented.

Extra Features (Additional features)

1. I have introduced the level feature up to 3 level. In each level bubble size increase and speed of movement is also increase.

2.When a bullet hits the larger bubbles, they split into smaller bubbles (half the radius of the original larger bubble) and move in horizontally opposite directions with different colour.

3. I added a total score which is increase by one when bullet hits the bubble, I also added total number of bullets left in shooter for whole game, and added a time which is decrease as level increase. (i.e., for level 1 = 50 sec, level 2= 40 sec, level 3=30 sec). I also added heath counter (total 3 lives for whole game)
